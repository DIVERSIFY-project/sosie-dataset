# sosie-dataset
This repository contains a collection of sosie programs that have been generated and manually selected by a team of researchers since early 2014. 

All sosies are variants of real-world Java open source projects, which are characterized by the following constraints:
- the point that varies between the original and the sosie is covered by, at least, one test case of the original program's test suite
- the sosie is a variant that successfully passes the complete test suite of the original program.

More details about the definition of sosie programs and how they are generated can be found in our [paper that was presented at ISSTA'14](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/938855/filename/sosies.pdf)
