\section{Introduction}

In this document we present a dataset of sosies that have been generated for large open source Java programs. 
The objective is to illustrate the diversity of situations in which we can generate good or bad sosies, as defined in our previous work \footnote{\url{https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/938855/filename/sosies.pdf}}. 

This dataset will grow in the future and will serve as the basis to establish a taxonomy of different code regions where we can synthesize valuable program sosies.
